# Effort.jl

`Effort` is a Julia package designed to emulate the computation of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure, as computed by [PyBird](https://github.com/pierrexyz/pybird). An emulator is a surrogate model, a computational technique that can mimick the behaviour of computationally expensive functions, with a speedup of several orders of magnitude.

The example page shows how to use Effort.jl, while showing its computational performance
